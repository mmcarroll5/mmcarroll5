<P> I have been playing basketball since the 4th grade. It is my passion. I started playing because my Mom played. And with my Dad as a former college athlete he became my first coach. Since then he has been my biggest supporter. Even though he is sometimes hard on me I know it comes from the heart.  

I played travel basketball since the 7th grade and have played basketball all over the east coast.
In the 10th grade I played for a travel team sponsored by Nike. That year we won the U15 girls Nike Nationals tournament. 
In high school, I played varsity basketball for my school all 4 years. We won our conference championship all 4 years and won the DC state championship my sophomore and senior year. Now, I am in my sophomore season playing Division 1 college basketball. I look back and cherish the opportunities and people that basketball has brought into my life.
