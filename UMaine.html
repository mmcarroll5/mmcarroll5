<P> The University of Maine is a new experience for me and a chance to be far from home and experience seasons for the first time. The coaches here are amazing and the campus is beautiful. My team mates are great which is another reason I knew this was the right fit for me. </p>
<ul>
<li> UMaine has one of the prettiest campuses </li>
<li> Women's Basketball program is not only a competitive program, but a family </li>
<li> the environment on this campus is very friendly and welcoming </li> 
<li> amount of students enrolled is a good size for a University, not too big and not too small </li>
